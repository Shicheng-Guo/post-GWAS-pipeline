CompGWAS is a pipeline built for post-GWAS analysis. With GWAS summary statistics as input, the pipeline will generate the following analysis:
* *Manhattan plot/QQ plot/LocusZoom*
* *Heritability estimation/annotation-stratified enrichment analysis*
* *GNOVA genetic correlation estimation with 2419 UKB traits + 210 phenotypes curated in LDhub*
* *UTMOST cross-tissue gene-trait association analysis*
